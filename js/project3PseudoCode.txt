Create a background image of first level
add mario image
add coin image
add target image

position each of the images appropriately according to the wireframe. 

Create an levelChanging incrementor variable which will be referenced in order to determine the positioning of mario and the target in the second levels etc.

Create an array for the background image attributes
create an array for marios position throughout the levels
create an array for the various target positions
create an array of questions and answers

use conditional logical to determine whether the user input is correct

On form submit

if logic is correct add a value to the score and move to the next level
if false move to the next level without adding anything to the score
regardless of if condition is met, increment the levelChanging incrementor and fade out the level, mario and the target.
after fade out complete, fade in next level.

repeat.
